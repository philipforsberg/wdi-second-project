## Groundhoppers

Hey, this is my app for my second project at General Assembly, and also my first full-stack app!
The general idea for the project came through some brainstorming, and spending a lot of time trying to find come up with a good idea. I first thought of something else related to football, that seemed to require knowledge I've not yet gotten. Then this came to my mind because it's an idea my father has asked several times if we should start doing, going to all the grounds in the professional league system.
It seemed to me that this could be fitting for this project, and still be working for an end result that I would enjoy.

### What I liked about this project
The thing I enjoyed the most about this project is the fact that I am now able to make a working full-stack application from a white page!

### Challenges faced
I met several bumps on the road during this project, but I think the biggest one was when I was implementing the google API for the map, and more specifically for the API for the google maps library, and making it automatically put up new markers for each new grounds post made.

### Ideas and plans for new features
Like any project I've done, I never feel that I'm completely done with this project, but the deadline came sooner than hoped. If I had more time, I would do a several bigger and minor changes to the CSS of the page, even the general layout of the page. First and foremost I need to clean up the code, and top of that list is again the SCSS.
Other things that would be high up on the list of things to do is to make user-pages, showing all the lists and grounds a user has visited/written about. And also make it possible to click on a particular grounds name, and see all the posts by all users on that ground.

### Acknowledgments
Thanks to my classmates for both help and motivation in the face of bigger and smaller bumps on the road! Also thanks to my dad for the inspiration to the idea that page is built on.
